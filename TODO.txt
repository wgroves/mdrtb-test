Decide what to do with date inputs (input type="date" is HTML5, there are JS solutions, etc)


Required and optional form elements

Form pages that come up only if certain checkboxes are checked (2B and 2C)

Think about special behavior for name="" and value="" for radio buttons and checkboxes during POSTing
