Decide what to do with date inputs (input type="date" is HTML5, there are JS solutions, etc)

Required and optional form elements

Form pages that come up only if certain checkboxes are checked (2B and 2C)

Think about special behavior for name="" and value="" for radio buttons and checkboxes during POSTing

Decide how to represent hierarchical inputs (example: several indented checkbox under one heading checkbox on form 2

Popup on form 3

<select>s probably shouldn't default to Present, e.g. form 4

Radio button arrays with an "other" text input option -- probably JS

Reports (see PowerPoint)

Continue buttons (back? etc) and all navigation logic

Name and date formats adjusting to locale (dates stored as epoch for sorting, displayed per locale works)

Databse encoding allows for many languages
